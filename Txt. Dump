-founded in 1926

-In 1931, Baldur von Schirach was appointed Reich Youth Leader and one of his primary goals was to unify all of the different Nazi youth organizations.

-By 1935, the HJ comprised 60 percent of the country’s youth. Following the Nazi seizure of power, other right-wing youth groups were merged into the HJ. From December 1, 1936, under the Jugenddienstpflicht all other youth groups were banned and their membership was merged into the Hitler Youth. HJ membership was made compulsory for youths over 17 in 1939, and for all over the age of 10 in 1941. By 1939, Hitler Youth membership comprised 90 percent of the country’s youth.
